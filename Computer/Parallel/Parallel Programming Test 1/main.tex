\section{Can we expand the size of the cache indefinitely? Why is that? (no more than 100 words)}
\textcolor{blue}{Tips: Cache is a really fast type of memory. A computer has multiple levels of memory. The first is primary storage, which could be a hard disk or an SSD storing the heavy data like your operating system and programs. Next is the RAM, can be much faster than your primary storage. Lastly you have cache, which comprises of the even faster memory units closer to compute units (e.g., ALUs).}
